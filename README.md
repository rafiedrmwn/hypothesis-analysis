## Overview
A fictitious fast-food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still undecided between the three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product. In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.

## Problem
Using the dataset, we have to do certain tasks, which are:
1. How is the character of the store in each type of market size?
2. Which promotion/campaign brings the greatest effect on sales?
3. Does the type of market size affect the results of the campaigns?
4. Is there any effect of age of store and type of market size on the sales generated?
